# Directives are registered in the order they should be executed.
#
# Ordering is VERY important. Every plugin will feel the effects of all other
# plugin below (after) them during a request, but they must not care what plugin
# above them are doing.

# How to rebuild with updated plugin configurations: Modify the list below and
# run `go generate && go build`

# The parser takes the input format of:
#
#     <plugin-name>:<package-name>
# Or
#     <plugin-name>:<fully-qualified-package-name>
#
# External plugin example:
#
# log:github.com/coredns/coredns/plugin/log
# Local plugin example:
# log:log
